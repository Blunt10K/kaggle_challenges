# kaggle_challenges

### My work on published Kaggle challenges/datasets. I delve into analysis and modelling and make use of Jupyter Notebooks to include thought processes and background information.

#### This is practice on some concepts I've learnt over the past few years:
 - Probability Theory
 - Data preprocessing/cleaning
 - Machine Learning
 - Deep Learning
 - Statistics
 - Modelling
 - Visualisations, etc
